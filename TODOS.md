The following issues may be improved one day:
* read datapoints from ets (dpt)
* support single quotes in item files,
  as for now only double quotes are supported
* Improve NS_URL = '{http://knx.org/xml/project/11}'
* As of now all items read from ETS which are not in any items file
  are handled as Switches.  Read *Project.xml* or alike and handle them properly.
* Determine based on *knxproj* files what are actors, controls, etc.
